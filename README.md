## Hardware

## 3D models
### Rudder pedals
Box for Arduino based mixer unit: 

### Thrust lever
I used this model as a basis for my print so I could integrate the angular sensor: https://www.printables.com/model/903412-big-lever
 
## Software

### Head Tracker
This project I use without modifications in two Arduino Nano BLE 33 for head and flightstick movement as well as to ingest the analog values from the
* Rudder Pedal
* Thrust lever
* Flap Switch
